The Dive teaches how to deliver a thrust and then leverage body weight through the head of the penis to draws a line of friction along the targeted wall during the exit stroke. When you witness a S.T.R.O.K.E that incorporates the Dive that Stroke will include a component that uses the Rocking technique during the exiting action. One will see the Dive often being a factor in Strokes that rapidly move in and out of the vagina, activating the shallowing technique by adding pressure to the vaginal opening during extraction.
','The Dip is a Key Stroke that is used to teach Angling and Shallowing and it is regularly used in the S.T.R.O.K.E system.  When you see a S.T.R.O.K.E that has a Dip element incorporated into it that stroke it will often be when a shallow stroke and depth stroke are connected together. Practicing the Dip is key because it is an introduction to linking Key Strokes together in combinations. The Dip teaches how to use Angling and Shallowing together by demonstrating how to apply leverage bodyweight to the head of the penis with the purpose of targeting a shallow wall. 
','The Ream is a key stroke that is used to teach Rocking. The Ream is regularly used in the S.T.R.O.K.E system. When you witness a S.T.R.O.K.E that has a Ream element incorporated into it the Ream element will be using the lateral shifting of the body to create leverage pressure against the left or right vaginal walls.The Ream teaches how to use the Rocking technique to use the pelvis to stimulate the vulva with a horozontal massage while leveraging body weight to apply a pressure massage against the left and right vaginal walls  using a lateral pressure massage to canvas the vaginal walls in a horozontal format allowing bodywight to create a lateral pressure massage against the vaginal walls.  
','The Stir is a Key Stroke that is used to teach Angling, and is regularly used in the S.T.R.O.K.E system. When you witness a S.T.R.O.K.E that has a Stir element incorporated into it you can assume that the Stir element in that stroke is primarily focused on using hilt to stretch and massage the opening of the vagina and uses broadening, the Stir creates a sensation of increased girth. The Stir teaches how to use Angling while fully inside of the vagina. With the Stir, bodyweight is applied through the shaft of the penis to apply pressure against the vaginal walls using Angling.  
','The Slip is a Key Stroke element that is used to teach Rocking and Shallowing. The Slip is regularly used in the S.T.R.O.K.E System. When you see a S.T.R.O.K.E that has a Slip element incorporated into it that stroke applies pressure to a wall during a depth stroke, meaning that it increases the pressure on a specific vaginal wall using the shaft of the penis while fully penetrated within the vagina. The Slip instructs on how to use Rocking and Shallowing together. The Slip uses a twist in the body while fully inserted to use leverage to initiate the Rocking techinque and increase pressure against a vaginal wall. When performing the exit stroke, the Slip engages shallowing as bodyweight is applied through the penis to directly impact the sensor laiden vaginal opening. 
','The Pop is a Key Stroke that is used to teach  Angling and Shallowing , and S.T.R.O.K.E  , when you see a S.T.R.O.K.E that has a Pop element incorporated into that stroke  it uses the lateral shifting of the hips to use the left or right surfaces of the shaft of the penis to apply internal pressure against the walls of the vagina.  
','The Crunch is a Key Stroke that is used to teach Shallowing and Rocking and it is regularly used in the S.T.R.O.K.E System. When you witness a S.T.R.O.K.E that has a Crush element incorporated into it, that stroke will often use the Crush to stimulate the compression of the clitoris with the shaft during the exit stroke. The Crush instructs in how to use the Rocking technique at the at the opening inches of the vagina. 
',"The Whip is a Key Stroke that is used to teach Angling and Rocking. The Whip is regularly used in the S.T.R.O.K.E System. One can realize a S.T.R.O.K.E that has a Whip element incorporated into it when that stroke displays various full body movements while fully penetrated in the vagina. The Whip uses the movement of the body's core to create leverage that applies pressure through the length of the shaft against various walls of the vagina while fully penetrated. The whip is often used in strokes to increase the pressure that an initial stroke creates amplifying the sensation of girth deep within the vagina. With the Whip, uses both Angling and Rocking techniques when full body horozontal movements are made the base of the penis moves along with it and when fully penetrated this causes a great deal of pressure down into vagina and against the vaginal walls through the shaft of the penis. This creates a stretching sensation and can engage various walls of the vagina all within one full body movement.
